- Categorical encoding

### 3. Model Training
- Trains multiple ML algorithms
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Cross-validation
- Model selection based on performance metrics

### 4. Model Evaluation
- Performance metrics calculation
- Model comparison
- Validation on test data

### 5. Model Deployment
- Model serialization
- Web API creation
- Containerization for deployment
